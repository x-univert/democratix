      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "Is my vote anonymous?",
        "answer": "Yes! DEMOCRATIX uses advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure your vote is completely anonymous. While your transaction is recorded on the blockchain, your actual vote choice is encrypted and cannot be linked to your wallet address."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "Do I need cryptocurrency to vote?",
        "answer": "Yes, you need a small amount of EGLD (MultiversX's native token) to pay for transaction fees (gas). The cost is minimal - typically less than $0.01 per vote."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "What is IPFS and why do you use it?",
        "answer": "IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a decentralized storage network. We use it to store election descriptions, candidate information, and images in a distributed way, ensuring data availability and censorship resistance."

      "q5": {
        "question": "Can I change my vote after submitting?",
